###How to add code within text

```java
final int BIG = 1000000000;
```

During this class we learned about using jshell for a few things. We tried using different infinities and realized a computer doesn't know infinity. 

```java
Integer.MAX_VALUE
DOUBLE.MAX_VALUE + 1
```

**NOTE**

Use _JSHELL_ to experiment
